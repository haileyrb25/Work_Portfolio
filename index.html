      <p>My name is Hailey Bates. I am a student in a full stack coding bootcamp from The University of Central Florida. Before working towards a coding certificate, I obtained my bachelor's in Philosophy from Florida International University. While studying, I had worked as an Assistant Manager for multiple restaurants across Florida for eight years. During my time in the food industry, I was able to strengthen my adaptability and decision making skills all while working in high-pressure environments.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While attending the full stack coding bootcamp, I was able to learn how to code using the Javascript language. I have a few work projects to highlight my best work while simply learning the criteria for success in the program. This means my work was only the beginning; more projects will enhance my skills in coding in order to provide the right help for an employer. My strongest skill is debugging and time-management. My goal is to amplify a firm or business with functional websites.</p>
