## Hailey Bates Work Portfolio
This is the work portfolio homework for UCF bootcamp, week 1!
For this repo, we have a code made from scratch to create a work portfolio for class and future jobs as a developer! In this assignment, I utilized flexbox in CSS to creat a webpage to mimic the example in the homework assignment. Future edits will be made to add future projects in order to get the final product
